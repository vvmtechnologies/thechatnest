## Update Log (2026-04-14)

Shipped in a single day across web, mobile and backend:

- **Web Push (VAPID)**: service-worker background notifications for messages,
  incoming calls, missed calls, meeting invites and screen-share requests.
  Set `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY`, `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY`, `VAPID_SUBJECT` in backend env
  and run migration `069_push_subscriptions.sql`.
- **External guest meetings**: email up to 2 external guests per meeting — they
  join via a secure `/guest/:token` link + 6-digit code with zero-signup guest
  JWT. Migration `070_meeting_guests.sql`.
- **Full-page meeting hub** at `/app/meeting` replacing the modal, with
  Instant / Schedule / Join tabs and a participant picker.
- **Meeting history**: past tab alongside upcoming, with duration and host.
- **Call history**: per-contact dialog from the chat header three-dot menu,
  All / Missed / Audio / Video filters. Migration `071_call_logs.sql` backs it.
- **Missed calls in chat**: declined / unanswered / offline calls post a
  `📞` entry into the DM for both sides.
- **Pinned chats**: up to 20 per user, sorted on top, real-time sync.
  Migration `072_user_thread_pins.sql`.
- **Call reliability**: 45s caller ring timeout, peer mute/camera badges,
  persistent remote audio across minimize, mobile↔web WebRTC interop fix,
  socket auto-reconnect on visibility/focus/online with fresh auth token.
- **DB**: migrations 069 → 073 added. `073_seed_today_features.sql` seeds 14
  user-facing items into `feature_items`. A paste-ready combined file for
  Neon lives at `backend/migrations/run_on_neon_today.sql`.

New routes:
- `GET /push/vapid-public-key`, `POST /push/subscribe`, `POST /push/unsubscribe`
- `GET /calls?peer_id=`
- `GET /meetings/past`, `GET /meetings/guest/:token`, `POST /meetings/guest/:token/verify`
- `POST /meetings/` now accepts `guest_emails: string[]` (max 2)

New socket events:
- `thread:pin` (client) · `thread:pin_sync`, `thread:pin_update` (server)
- Signal subtype `call:signal { type: 'media-state', muted?, videoOff? }`
- Guest JWTs carry `guest: true` and are recognised by `authenticateSocket`;
  guest sockets skip presence/sync and only run meeting handlers.
