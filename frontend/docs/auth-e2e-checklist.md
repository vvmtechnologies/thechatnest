# Frontend Auth E2E Checklist

Last updated: 2026-03-09

## Login + OTP

- Open `/auth/login`, submit valid email/password (untrusted device).
- Confirm OTP step opens and resend button starts cooldown timer.
- OTP input should accept numeric digits only.
- Enter invalid OTP once:
  - attempts panel should appear
  - attempts-left metadata should update from API
- Enter 6 valid digits, then click verify button:
  - login should complete
  - redirect to `/app`.
- If attempts reach `0`:
  - OTP input and verify button should remain disabled.
- Wrong OTP or resend action should clear OTP input boxes.
- After logout, login again from same device:
  - OTP should not be asked again.

## OTP Resend

- During cooldown, resend button remains disabled.
- After cooldown, resend works and cooldown restarts.
- If backend returns `retry_after_seconds`, UI timer syncs to that value.

## Refresh Security

- Keep app idle until access token nears expiry, confirm silent refresh works.
- Reuse/revoked refresh token simulation should trigger forced logout:
  - local auth cleared
  - redirect to login.

## Trusted Device Management

- Open settings activity tab.
- Trusted device badge appears for trusted sessions.
- Click `Revoke trust` on a trusted device:
  - badge removed
  - device session revoked from list.

## CSRF Retry

- Force CSRF mismatch on an unsafe request.
- Frontend should call `GET /auth/csrf` automatically and retry request once.

## Activity Timeline

- In settings activity tab, verify auth timeline cards render:
  - login
  - refresh
  - logout / security events.

  - confetti visibility fixed.
- Billing UI updates:
  - Subscription Overview uses preset/theme palette colors.
  - readability improved for top status chips.
- User management updates:
  - add user flow optimized (non-blocking credential mail + faster dialog close).
  - role mapping locked:
    - organization create default role = `3`.
    - user form platform admin = `2`, otherwise `4`.
  - default toggles remain unchecked unless user explicitly selects.
- Added/updated migrations:
  - `030_reset_and_seed_plans_reasonable_pricing.sql`
